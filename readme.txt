To implement an Abstract Factory design pattern I created a customized Cake Bakery Application;

- created the abstract factory class and two factory classes that extend it, 
- created 3 different types of products and their specific implementation
 
Note: 	Poly happens when the client sends the message to the concrete Factory
		P2I used: in Abstract classes in the product when creating concrete products;
